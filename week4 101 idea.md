1. Facial recognition system
	A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. This technology secures our properties and is prevalent in our daily life. Facial recognition system has been put inro wider uses in recent times on mobile platforms. This technology is deeply rooted in our life and thus I want to dig deeper into this.

2. Self driving car
	A self driving car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.Seld driving car has been a dream of us mankind and this dream of ours is finalizing over the last decade. The technology hidden within is definitely intriguing and worth researching.
    
3. Virtual Reality
	VR is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment such as video games and educational purposes such as medical or military training. Other distinct types of VR style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality. 
    
4. 3D Printing
	The 3D printing process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design (CAD) model, usually by successively adding material layer by layer, which is why it is also called additive manufacturing, unlike conventional machining, casting and forging processes, where material is removed from a stock item (subtractive manufacturing) or poured into a mold and shaped by means of dies, presses and hammers.

5.Electric cars
	An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using energy stored in rechargeable batteries. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles. From 2008, a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve urban air quality. The technology involved is very important and I'm interested in knowing.
