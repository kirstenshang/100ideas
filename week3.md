	Internet Archive provides free public access to collections of digitized materials, including websites, software applications, music, moving images, and millions of public-domain books. In addition to its archiving function, the Archive is an activist organization, advocating for a free and open Internet. The Internet Archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers, which work to preserve as much of the public web as possible. Shortly after the GeoCities closing announcement, the Internet Archive announced a project to archive GeoCities pages. 
    The website InternetArchaeology.org also archived and is showcasing artifacts from GeoCities. The operators of the website Reocities downloaded as much of the content that was hosted on GeoCities as they could before Geocities shut down.
    Another site attempted to build an archive of  GeoCities websites is GeoCities.ws. However, there is no formal relationship between GeoCities and geocities.ws. Many sites were automatically duplicated from GeoCities to geocities.ws many months after the closure of GeoCities.
