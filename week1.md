1. What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons?
	According to what I've perceived, 'flame war'is when people exchange or use abusive diction through internet on one another. I do not really know the connection between a 'flame war' and emoticons, but I guess that emoticons help users to express their emotions.
2. What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? Support your answer with references beyond the book.
	Emoticons use different kinds of punctuations combing to create some kind of facisl expressions, whereas emojis are actual images of faces that represent our emotions. 
3. Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means. List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.
	A'lossy' compression means that the data or quality of the original file is more or less lost. 
    (1)PNG - Portable Network Graphics, PNG supports lostless compression instead of lossy compresson.
    (2)GIF - Graphics Interchange Format, also using lostless compression.
4. List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book.
	(1) when using music app, there is a file includes artist's name and information about this artist and what genre of music he or she makes.
    (2)I thought of the hashtags on instagram, i think those are also a good examples of acting like metamedia and collecting data together.
    (3)Word Document, evey word processing software collects some degree of standard metadata and enables the users to add their own fields for each document.
