Paul wanted so much to build the largiest library that he established the Mundaneum, which intend to collect the world's published knowledge. And the volunteers worked there were known as the Index Card Internet. When the Soviet Union lauched Sputnik 1 satellite to the space during Cold War, the American government established ARPA(Advanced Research Projects Agency) to study new military technology, and ARPAnet was the by-product. The US was worried the nuclear strike would wipe out their communication, so they created the protected emergency system, which is the ARPAnet. ARPAnet connects geographically different systems together to share information. However, each host computer still spoke a different language, and there is a way needed to talk to each other. Until 1974 Internet Protocol was invented by Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf. The internet protocol makes the communications between computers possible. Wifi is also invented so that indtead of using a modem for only one device, all the devices within certain range can gain wireless access to the internet. Now we are able to connect our device to wifi to surf on internet and look into the World Wide Web.
